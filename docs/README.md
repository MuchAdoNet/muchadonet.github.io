# Introduction

The **MuchAdo** class library provides an intuitive API for [working with relational databases](./databases.md) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It is [similar to Dapper](./other-libraries.md) and other micro ORMs for .NET.

```csharp
var shortWidgets = await connector
    .CommandFormat(
        $"select id, name from widgets where height <= {maxHeight}")
    .QueryAsync<(long Id, string Name)>(cancellationToken);
```

To use MuchAdo, add a reference to the [NuGet package](./databases.md) that corresponds to your database. Strongly consider adding a reference to [MuchAdo.Analyzers](./analyzers.md) as well.

## Key Features

Follow the links below for detailed information on MuchAdo features.

* [**Databases**](./databases.md) — Work with ADO.NET providers, including provider-specific packages and connector classes for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.
* [**Connections**](./connections.md) — Create and dispose connectors, open and close connections automatically, and configure connector settings.
* [**Commands**](./commands.md) — Execute SQL and stored procedures, read records with query and enumeration methods, set command timeouts, cancel commands, and handle execution events.
* [**Command Batches**](./command-batches.md) — Execute multiple SQL statements in one database call, read multiple result sets, and build batches incrementally.
* [**Transactions**](./transactions.md) — Run manual and automatic transactions, configure transaction settings, roll back uncommitted work, and attach existing transactions.
* [**Data Mapping**](./data-mapping.md) — Map data records to strings, value types, enums, blobs, DTOs, tuples, dynamic objects, dictionaries, custom mappers, and mapping delegates.
* [**Formatted SQL**](./formatted-sql.md) — Build SQL from interpolated fragments and parameter values, including raw SQL, quoted names, concatenation helpers, lists, tuples, clauses, and SQL keyword helpers.
* [**Parameters**](./parameters.md) — Inject parameters safely, expand collection parameters, use named and unnamed parameter sources, generate DTO-based parameters, create `LIKE` parameters, set parameter types, and combine parameter sources.
* [**Resilience**](./resilience.md) — Retry opening connections, running transactions, executing commands or command batches, and wrapping arbitrary idempotent actions.
* [**Optimizations**](./optimizations.md) — Improve performance with prepared commands, cached commands, and connector pooling.
* [**Analyzers**](./analyzers.md) — Add analyzer warnings for potentially incorrect library usage, such as interpolated strings passed to `Command`.
* [**Other Libraries**](./other-libraries.md) — Compare MuchAdo with Dapper across connection handling, query buffering, command batching, transaction tracking, mapping, SQL building, parameters, and optimizations.
