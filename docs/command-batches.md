# Command Batches

To execute multiple SQL statements in one database call, which can improve performance for databases with significant latency, chain multiple calls to `Command` and/or `CommandFormat`. MuchAdo uses ADO.NET provider support for [`DbBatch`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.common.dbbatch) to efficiently execute multiple commands.

```csharp
var newWidgetId = connector
    .CommandFormat(
        $"insert into widgets (name, height) values ({name}, {height})")
    .Command("select last_insert_id()")
    .QuerySingle<long>();
```

If your provider does not support `DbBatch`, you may be able to execute multiple statements in a single command by separating the SQL statements with semicolons.

```csharp
var nextWidgetId = connector
    .CommandFormat($"""
        insert into widgets (name, height) values ({name}, {height});
        select last_insert_id();
        """)
    .QuerySingle<long>();
```

:::tip
Microsoft.Data.Sqlite does not support `DbBatch` (as of this writing), but [MuchAdo.Sqlite](./databases.md#sqlite) emulates support, so either syntax can be used.
:::

Note that any timeout specified by `WithTimeout` applies to the entire command batch, not an individual command. Similarly, `InTransaction`, `Retry`, `RetryInTransaction`, `Cache`, and `Prepare` apply to the whole command batch.

## Reading result sets

If only one of the SQL statements returns data records, or if all of the statements return the same kind of record, you can read the data as usual with one of the `Query` or `Enumerate` methods.

If each statement returns a different kind of data record, call `QueryMultipleAsync` to get a result set reader, which should always be disposed. For each statement that returns records, call one of the `Read` or `Enumerate` methods.

```csharp
await using (var reader = await connector
    .Command("select name from widgets where height < 5")
    .Command("select id from widgets where height >= 5")
    .QueryMultipleAsync())
{
    shortWidgetNames.AddRange(await reader.ReadAsync<string>());
    longWidgetIds.AddRange(await reader.ReadAsync<long>());
}
```

`QueryMultipleAsync` also has an overload with a delegate parameter that automatically disposes the result set reader.

```csharp
var (moreWidgetNames, moreWidgetIds) = await connector
    .Command("select name from widgets where height < 5")
    .Command("select id from widgets where height >= 5")
    .QueryMultipleAsync(async reader =>
        (ShortWidgetNames: await reader.ReadAsync<string>(),
            LongWidgetIds: await reader.ReadAsync<long>()));
```

The result set reader also supports `ReadFirstAsync`, `ReadFirstOrDefaultAsync`, `ReadSingleAsync`, `ReadSingleOrDefaultAsync`, and `EnumerateAsync`. Each call consumes the current result set and advances to the next one when it finishes.

## Empty command batch

When building a command batch in a loop, it may be simpler to call `CreateCommandBatch` and start with an empty command batch.

```csharp
var batch = connector.CreateCommandBatch();
foreach (var widget in widgetsToCreate)
{
    batch.CommandFormat($"""
        insert into widgets (name, height)
            values ({widget.Name}, {widget.Height})
        """);
    batch.Command("select last_insert_id()");
}
var newWidgetIds = await batch.QueryAsync<long>();
```

Use `CommandCount` to inspect how many commands have been added. `GetCommand` returns a `DbConnectorCommand` with its command type, SQL or text, and parameters; call `BuildText` with the connector's `SqlSyntax` when you need to render its text for logging. `SetCommand` can replace a command in an existing batch.

## ADO.NET access

While a command batch is being executed, the `ActiveBatch` property of the connector will be set to the corresponding `DbBatch`.
